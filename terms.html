    content="Borne out of COVID-19 job loss and internship cancellations, Practicum was founded and is fully operated by a team of college students from around the United States. We aim to put together teams of 5-10 undergraduate engineers with early-stage startup founders and technical mentors that have an industry background. Our ultimate goal for the summer is to empower a community of students and young professionals to work on meaningful projects, grow their network, and develop real-world skills that they can take with them beyond our program.">
