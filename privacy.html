      <p class="privacy-intro"><strong>Your privacy is critically important to us.</strong></p>
      <p>It is Practicum's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
        This Privacy Policy applies to https://www.practicum.us/ (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://www.practicum.us/").
        We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website.
        We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website,
        how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.
        This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection
        of information from other sources.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies
        governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to
        additional terms and conditions.</p>
      <hr>
      <strong>Age</strong>
      <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that
        you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services.
        If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account
        and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from
        children under age 18, please contact us at info@practicum.us.</p>
      <hr>
      <strong>Website Visitors</strong>
      <p>Like most website operators, Practicum collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers
        typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
        Practicum's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Practicum's visitors use its website.
        From time to time, Practicum may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on
        trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Practicum also may collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Any information you
        submit may also be used for purposes such as forming project groups, connecting with mentors, and background verification. </p>
      <hr>
      <strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong>
      <p>Certain visitors to Practicum's websites choose to interact with Practicum in ways that require Practicum to gather personally-identifying
        information. The amount and type of information that Practicum gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. We will then use this
        information to provide you with services and generally fulfill business obligations. For example, when you submit personal and professional
        information (e.g. resumes and personal websites), we can use and disclose it for purposes such as forming project groups, connecting with
        mentors, and background verification. While we will strive to only share relevant and necessary information with third-parties, we cannot
        make guarantees on its absolute privacy, and by submitting your information and using this site, you hereby acknowledge and accept these risks. </p>
      <hr>
      <strong>Security</strong>
      <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.</p>
      <hr>
      <strong>Advertisements</strong>
      <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
        recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
        This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
        This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Practicum and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
      <hr>
      <strong>Links to External Sites</strong>
      <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to
        that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit. We have no
        control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

        personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website
        each time the visitor returns. Practicum uses cookies to help Practicum identify and track visitors, their usage of https://www.practicum.us/,
        and their website access preferences. Practicum visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers

      <strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Practicum may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Practicum's sole discretion.
        Practicum encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any
        change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
